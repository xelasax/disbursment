    ## Security

    At DisburseCloud, safeguarding the security and integrity of financial transactions is our top priority. Our API employs robust authentication mechanisms, and one central component of our security framework is the authentication endpoint. This endpoint serves as the primary method for user authentication, ensuring secure access to our API's powerful functionality.

    ### **How It Works**

    When you submit your credentials to our authentication endpoint, you initiate a secure authentication process. Upon successful authentication, the system grants you an access token, also known as a Bearer token. This token is essential for authorizing subsequent API calls, allowing you to securely interact with our endpoints.

    ### **Generating and Managing Your Bearer Tokens**

    Generating your Bearer tokens is a simple process. After authentication, you'll receive a personalized token with a validity period of 3600 seconds. You can obtain this token programmatically via API calls.

    ### **Securing Your Bearer Tokens**

    Protecting your Bearer tokens is crucial to maintain the security of your account and financial data. Store your tokens securely and avoid exposing them publicly or embedding them directly in your application code. Instead, use trusted methods like environment variables or a secure vault solution.

    ### **Using Your Bearer Tokens**

    To access our API services, include your Bearer token in the Authorization header of your API requests. This ensures uninterrupted and secure interaction with our endpoints, allowing you to leverage our API's functionality with confidence.

    By following these personalized guidelines and leveraging your Bearer token, you can confidently access the DisburseCloud API, knowing that your financial transactions are secure and confidential.

      summary: Access Token
      description: |-
        This endpoint acts as the gateway for user authentication using provided credentials. Upon successful authentication, an access token (Bearer token) is issued, which must be included in the Authorization header for authentication in all subsequent endpoint calls.

        This token, obtained in the response body, is vital for accessing other endpoints securely. Tokens expire after 3600 seconds, so ensure timely renewal for uninterrupted access.

        ```
        Authorization: Bearer {{access_token obtained in response body}}
        ```


        Authentication to obtain an `access_token` is done using Basic Authentication with the __Company TIN__ as the `username` and __API key__ as the `password`.

        To obtain the API Key:
        1. Login to your dashbaord and click on admin on the right top corner
        2. Select Profile  and click on View API Key


        For a __Multi-Company user__, it is crucial to include the `CompanyApiKey` in the __header__.

        This key uniquely identifies the *specific company being accessed through the API* and is essential for proper authentication and authorization.


        ```
        CompanyApiKey: {{your company's api key}}
